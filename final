## installing libraries
import numpy as np
import os
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
# for tensorflow you first have to install it
#import tensorflow as tf
#import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
#import pandas as pd

## setting working directory, in the second line add your directory
print("Current Working Directory " , os.getcwd())
os.chdir("/Users/bejbcia/pythonprojects/Machine Learning/ML Challenge")

## loading the data

spoken_train = np.load("spoken_train.npy", allow_pickle=True)
spoken_test = np.load("spoken_test.npy", allow_pickle=True)
match_train = np.load("match_train.npy", allow_pickle=True)



# subsetting the data to get some test set
written_train_test = written_train[:4000,:]
written_train_train = written_train[4000:,:]
spoken_train_test = spoken_train[:4000]
spoken_train_train = spoken_train[4000:]
match_train_test = match_train[:4000] 
match_train_train = match_train[4000:]
